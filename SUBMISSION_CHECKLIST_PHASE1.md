## 📊 Spec-Driven Development Evidence

**Documentation Trail**:
1. ✅ `specs/phase1-console-app/spec.md` - User journeys, acceptance criteria
2. ✅ `specs/phase1-console-app/plan.md` - Architecture, component design
3. ✅ `specs/phase1-console-app/tasks.md` - 18 atomic tasks (T-001 to T-018)
4. ✅ Git commit message references tasks and specs
5. ✅ Code comments reference task IDs

**Proof of No Manual Coding**:
- All code generated via Claude Code
- Clear spec → plan → tasks → implement workflow
- Task references in code comments

---
