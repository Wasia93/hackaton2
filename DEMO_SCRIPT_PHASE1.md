## Good Luck! 🚀

Remember:
- **Quality over perfection** - A clear 90-second demo is better than a perfect 2-minute one
- **Show, don't tell** - Demonstrate features rather than explaining code
- **Be enthusiastic** - Show excitement about what you built!
- **Practice** - Run through 2-3 times before final recording
